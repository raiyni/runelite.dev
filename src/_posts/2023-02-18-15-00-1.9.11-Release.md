### Profiles

Profiles have been added to RuneLite, which are separate sets of plugins and settings that can be switched between at any time. There is a new UI in the configuration panel for managing profiles. Profiles are useful for players who want different settings for different accounts, or for different activites.

Your existing settings will be migrated into a single profile named `default` automatically.

In addition to creating and deleting profiles, the profile panel also allows duplicating (copying an existing profile's settings to a new profile), exporting, and importing profiles.

For advanced users, there is a new `--profile` client argument to choose the profile the client uses at startup. By default the client will select the profile it was last using. If you currently use the `--config` client argument, import the config file you use into a new profile, and then use `--profile name` to launch the client with that profile.

### Launcher updates

Last week we began showing an outdated launcher warning to a small percentage of users whose launcher version is 1.6 or older (prior to Aug 2019). If you are receiving this warning at startup, you should update your launcher to the latest version by redownloading RuneLite from [https://runelite.net](https://runelite.net). You don't need to uninstall your previous launcher, and also your settings will not be reset.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Player indicators has an option to disable when outside of PvP
- Camera plugin expand pitch mode now also expands the lower pitch limit
- Various missing random events were added to the random event plugin
- Entity hider can now hide random events
- 1 defence and level 3 combat hiscores have been added to the hiscore plugin
- Volcanic mine ore packs have been added to the loot tracker
- xBR UI scaling now works correctly on M1 Macs
- Farmer's affinity has been added to the timers plugin
- A bug causing timers to turn red too early has been fixed
