title: '1.8.0 Release'
description: 'Uncapped frame rate'
author: Adam
---

The GPU plugin has a new `Unlock FPS` option which disables the 50 FPS hard cap on the client and allows the client to render frames at the maximum rate supported by your system. For most users, this will be 60 FPS, unless you have a display and GPU which supports a higher refresh rate. The higher frame rate is applied to camera movements, like how the steam and mobile clients work, which results in a smoother feel when moving the camera with mouse or keyboard input.

### MacOS M1 Launcher

If you missed the previous blog, a native launcher for the Apple M1/M1 Pro/M1 Max is now available. If you have one of these systems and haven't already, we highly recommend downloading the newer launcher [here](https://github.com/runelite/launcher/releases/download/2.2.0/RuneLite-aarch64.dmg).

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Selected bank tag tabs no longer get applied to shared storage. You may additionally also search shared storage using bank tag names when a bank tag is selected
- The actions required in the skill calculator now no longer sometimes give incorrect results when using partial xp
- The `!pets` command now correctly recognizes pet chinchompas
- The Shared Storage button no longer overlaps the bank capacity interface
- A bug causing HD healthbars widths to be incorrect was fixed
- `Lookup` was added to player names in the group ironman group list
- `!kc gg` and `ggs` short names were added for Grotesque Guardians
- A bird nest tier setting was added to the Woodcutting plugin to allow only sending notifications for bird nests of a certain clue level
- The spec counter now has a configuration option for the bulwark special attack threshold
- The black `Loading` and `Connection lost` boxes now get drawn correctly in the upper left when GPU is enabled
- The prayer dose overlay now correctly computes how much prayer sanfew serums restore

Enjoy!
