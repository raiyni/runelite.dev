### UI swaps

Many UI elements now support the shift-right-click swap configuration that we've been standardizing on lately. This works on things such as spells, items in the bank, and in shops. When set on items in the bank or on a shop interface, the configuration is per-item, which allow easily configuring eg. one item as withdraw-x while another is withdraw-1.

Due to the standardization of swaps around the shift-click configure method, many of the existing swaps built into the plugin are no longer necessary. We're removed some of the less used swaps with this update. If you notice one is missing, shift-right click the npc/object/ui and re-configure it using the new system.

### Tombs of Amascut

We've been working on updates in preparation for Tombs of Amascut coming on the 24th. There is a new runepouch overlay for runepouches with 4 rune stacks due to the text not fitting on the rune pouch. It displays a green bar for rune quantities 1-10k and a red bar for anything under 1k. The old display format is still used for pouches with less than 4 stacks of runes.

ToA has been added to the hiscore panel:

Additionally, we've been able to add loot tracking for Tombs of Amascut already and expect it to be working for release day.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Minor graphical inconsistences on GPU with `compute shaders` off have been fixed, such as the GE floor appearing to have white dots between the tiles
- The maximum model size on GPU with `compute shaders` on has been increased. This may cause some additional GPU load in busy areas, but is required to get the ToA bosses to render correctly.
- Clan members are included in the hiscore search name autocompleter
- Clan members previous chat message ranks no longer change to "unranked" after they log out
- Friends chat rank icon now displays to the left of the user's name instead of to the right of the channel name
- Bank searching by value now supports searching by per-item value. For example, `per >5k` finds any stack of items where the individual items are worth more than 5k each, while `>5k` finds any stack of items worth more than 5k total.
- Members items in a free to play world now show their name with `(Members)` appended, eg `Abyssal whip (Members)`, instead of `Members object`. Making it easier to identify items on free to play worlds.
- The loot tracker no longer shows member items as `Members object` when logged into a free to play world.
- The double ammo mould has been added to the smelting plugin
- Clown `:O)` and cow `3:O` have been added to the Emoji plugin.
- The agility plugin once again highlights the skull slope obstacle clickbox

Enjoy!
