## Map loading improvements

The short `Loading - please wait` freeze which happens when a new map is loaded (also sometimes referred to as crossing "loading lines") has been greatly reduced, and in many cases, completely removed. This allows for a much smoother game play experience, and is most noticible in content like the Gauntlet and Chambers of Xeric which have multiple map loads. We've also fixed projectiles so they no longer disappear when loading a new map.

#### Jagex Account PSA

With Jagex recently pushing people towords using the new Jagex Account system, we've seen many people lock themselves out of their accounts by migrating their account without fully understanding the consequences. This occurs most prominently to users whose computers can not run the Jagex Launcher. Please do not migrate your accounts without first verifying that the Jagex Launcher works on _all_ of the computers you play on.

Jagex Accounts are still in beta, and so it is expected there will be some teething problems. If your computer does not support the Jagex launcher we highly recommend _not_ migrating your account yet as you will be unable to play on RuneLite.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Multi kills on abyssal demons on task are now correctly counted
- Mirror shield's "mirror" effect now renders correctly on GPU
- `Walk here` can now be swapped on a per-object basis, similar to NPCs
- Profiles can now be reordered via drag and drop in the profile list
- Fix the ring of forging tracker being off by 1
- The GE plugin can now notify you when an offer is fully complete, instead of on each update
